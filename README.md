# CrowdMeter
Crowd Meter designed for the campus recreation center that utilizs a QR-code based login system. These logins are added to a counter, which simulataneously runs a function to reduce the counter after the average amount of time an individual inhabits a gym. This was my first Hackathon project and was built with Flutter and Back4App.
