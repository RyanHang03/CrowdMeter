# CrowdMeter
Crowd Meter designed for the campus recreation center that utilizs a QR-code based login system. These logins are added to a counter, which simulataneously runs a function to reduce the counter after the average amount of time an individual inhabits a gym. This was my first Hackathon project and was built with Flutter and Back4App.

Goals:
- A basic mapping of an app with a home page, a login page, a QR code to be used to login, and some sort of back end for handling the data.
- Fluid transitions between states

Pros:
- The project's webpages function as we had hoped
- Working crowd meter based that updates per login and per state refresh

Cons:
- We weren't able to fully implement an authentication/login system, but given the opportunity to revisit the project or a similar project, I would definitely attempt to do so once again.
- The code's cleanliness is less than ideal.
